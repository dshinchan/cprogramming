//771. Jewels and Stones

/*
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<jewels.size();i++){
            for(int j=0;j<stones.size();j++){
                if(jewels[i]==stones[j])
