//1528. Shuffle String

/*Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length.

The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.
Example 3:

Input: s = "aiohn", indices = [3,1,4,2,0]
Output: "nihao"
Example 4:

Input: s = "aaiougrt", indices = [4,0,2,6,7,3,1,5]
Output: "arigatou"
Example 5:

Input: s = "art", indices = [1,0,2]
Output: "rat"
